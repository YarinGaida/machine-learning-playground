# 🧠 Machine Learning Playground

Welcome!  
This repository is my personal **Machine Learning & Data Science portfolio**, containing notebooks, exercises, and small projects that I’ve built while studying and experimenting with ML concepts.

It includes both **university assignments** and **independent projects**, written to demonstrate clean, reproducible code and a strong understanding of core algorithms and workflows.
